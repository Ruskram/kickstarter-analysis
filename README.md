# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to help an upcoming playwright named Louise. She has a idea for a play called "Fever" and determined that it will cost her 10,000+ dollars to fund what she needs to make the play happen. She wants to start a crowdfunding campign to raise the money. This is where she needs our help. She has a list of data from all the kickstarters that happened over a 9 year period. There is a lot of data there and Louise dosen't know how to make sense of it.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This graph was made to look at all the Theater kickstarters and the month that they started. This is to see if there is any impact to the success of a kickstarter based on when it starts. To come up with this analysis a few things needed to be done. First the data needed to be more refined so that it can be filtered in a way that only the desired data will show up. To do this the column "Category and Subcategory" needed to be broken up. This was done by copying the column and pasting it into the next available blank column. Using the data tab in the excel ribbon, there is a button called "Text to Columns". This button allows you to seperate the text in one column in to multiple columns by using the "Delimited" option and selecting "/" as the delimiter.

After this was done the new columns where renamed Parent category and Subcategory. This allows much easier filtering to find more specific information from the large amount of data.

Next, the data and the new columns where put into a pivot table. The pivot table is a great tool that allows data to be visualized by draging the desired information into 4 categories Filters, Columns, Rows, and Values. One challange that was encounters was that I had not used a pivot table before, so figuring out how to get all the information that was needed in the pivot table was a struggle. I kept experimenting with the categories until I was able to filter and show the information that I needed.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
